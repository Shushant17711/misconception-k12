</taxonomy>

items.json in the current directory lists the items: id, image (photo of the student's working, in this directory), grade, topic, question (Indonesian, LaTeX), question_image (diagram file or null), correct_answer (answer key), past_labels (how often each label was the root misconception for OTHER students on this same question, as [code, share] - a base rate only: the photo decides; codes outside this list are allowed).

For EVERY item: Read the photo (and question_image if present). Photos may be rotated, faint, or have crossed-out parts. Then
1. Transcribe the working line by line: "L1 | ...\nL2 | ..." (verbatim; annotator notes in [brackets], e.g. [crossed out]).
2. Solve the question yourself and check each student step.
3. Pick the ROOT misconception: the major error (one that changes the reasoning or result) that the rest of the working follows from, not necessarily the first error written. If the working is fully correct or has only minor slips (e.g. imprecise notation that does not change the result) the label is NONE. About a third of items are NONE.
4. Give the 3 most likely codes (taxonomy ids or NONE), ranked, each with your probability (the three need not sum to 1).

Only read files in the current directory. Your FINAL message must be ONLY a JSON array, no prose, no code fence:
[{"id": ..., "transcription": "...", "reasoning": "<=2 sentences", "top3": [["CODE", p], ["CODE", p], ["CODE", p]]}, ...]
